# Advent of Code 2022

...but with a slight twist. I will be trying to solve the problems in one line of code using Python 3.9. Code readability is usually important, but here it's completely optional. Expect solutions that are hard to read and/or very inefficient.

If I have time, I will also try to explain each solution in a README file found in each day's folder. I probably won't end up doing this for every solution.

## Rules

- To state the obvious, copying someone else's solution is not allowed.
- A solution is only valid if it is a maximum of one line of code per part.
- Importing libraries is strongly discouraged unless completing the challenge without doing so is unreasonable, and if used, the import must be on the same line as the solution.
  - Imports are limited to the standard library.
- Solutions don't need to be human-readable.

## Notes

Input files are opened using `open('input.txt')` (or whatever the input file format happens to be), so the current working directory matters when running the code.

These solutions frequently contain list comprehensions. If you're not familiar with them, some good resources to check out are:
- [Official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions)
- [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-list-comprehension/)
- [RealPython](https://realpython.com/list-comprehension-python/)
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_comprehension.asp)
