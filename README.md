# Advent of Code 2022

...but with a slight twist. I will be trying to solve the problems in one line of code using Python 3.9. Code readability is usually important, but here it's completely optional. Expect solutions that are hard to read and/or very inefficient.

If I have time, I will also try to explain each solution in a README file found in each day's folder. I probably won't end up doing this for every solution.

## Notes

Input files are opened using `open('input.txt')` (or whatever the input file format happens to be), so the current working directory matters when running the code.
